## Colophon

This toolkit was hand-built by Ed Saul as part of a broader exploration into digital reliability and poetic infrastructure.
It reflects a desire for transparency, modularity, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing your site is alive and well.

Tools: Python, YAML, DNSPython, OpenSSL  
Design: Minimal, functional, and unapologetically nerdy  
Philosophy: Monitoring as a form of care

# Colophon

## Design Philosophy
Inspired by the Bauhaus ethos:  
> *“Form follows function.”*  

Each module is discrete, purposeful, and transparent.  
The system favors simplicity over spectacle, and reliability over reach.

## Naming
“Web Watchdog” evokes a quiet guardian—observing, logging, alerting.  
It’s not flashy. It’s faithful.

## Hosting
This repository lives on GitHub Pages, chosen for its simplicity and static reliability.

## Author
Crafted by [Ed Saul](https://easysynth.co.uk), bridge engineer and analog tinkerer.  
A believer in poetic structure, technical clarity, and the joy of digital detective work.
