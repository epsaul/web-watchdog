## Colophon

This toolkit was hand-built by Ed Saul as part of a broader exploration into digital reliability and poetic infrastructure.
It reflects a desire for transparency, modularity, and the quiet satisfaction of knowing your site is alive and well.

Tools: Python, YAML, DNSPython, OpenSSL  
Design: Minimal, functional, and unapologetically nerdy  
Philosophy: Monitoring as a form of care
